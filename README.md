# GooglePlacesLocator

Notice: This project will be somewhat complicated to set up in android studio, expect around an hour or two for set up.

Ive uploaded it simply as an addition to a personal portfolio.

The xml will need reconfiguring for Google Licenses, Google requires every unique computer to have a unique license for its maps API. You can find detailed instructions about this process online. 

This will also require an ideal SDK version of 21.. hasnt been tested on the latest versions.

----

This app demonstrates use of the Google Maps API, Google Places API, an implementation of parceable, use of memory, sqllite, asynchronous tasks, JSON parsing, as well as numerous Android bells and whistles.

This app was never intended to look pretty.

I suggest a direct pull through to Android Studio.

# GooglePlacesLocator

Notice: This project will be somewhat complicated to set up in android studio, expect around an hour or two for set up.

Java src files for this proect can be found here: https://github.com/lambergr/GooglePlacesLocator/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/greg/lambertfinal

Ive uploaded it simply as an addition to a personal portfolio.

I suggest use of genymotion and virtualbox as the source of emulation. The emulators will need to be configured so they will connect to the internet. This is a long process better explaind on various websites across the web. Also Genymotion is no longer free for indie development.

You will need to install google play services

The xml manifest will need reconfiguring for Google API keys, Google requires every unique computer to have a unique license for its maps API. You can find detailed instructions about this process online. 


----

This app demonstrates use of the Google Maps API, Google Places API, an implementation of parceable, use of memory, sqllite, asynchronous tasks, JSON parsing, as well as numerous Android bells and whistles.

This app was never intended to look pretty.

I suggest a direct pull through to Android Studio.

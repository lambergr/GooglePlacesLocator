# GooglePlacesLocator

This app will list all registered google place locations within 500 meters of the phone. The user may also select certain types of places to display. These locations can be displayed on a google map. This app also features a database which can store locations favorited by the user. These favorited locations can be seen on a google map at the click of a menu button. 

Notice: This project will be somewhat complicated to set up in android studio, expect around an hour or two for set up.

Java src files for this project can be found here: https://github.com/lambergr/GooglePlacesLocator/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/greg/lambertfinal

Manifest file to place your Google API Auth Key:

Ive uploaded it simply as an addition to a personal portfolio.

I suggest use of genymotion and virtualbox as the source of emulation. The emulators will need to be configured so they will connect to the internet. This is a long process better explaind on various websites across the web. Also Genymotion is no longer free for indie development.

You will need to install google play services

The xml manifest will need reconfiguring for Google API keys, Google requires every unique computer to have a unique license for its maps API. You can find detailed instructions about this process online.

# Backend Functionalities

This app demonstrates use of the Google Maps API, Google Places API, an implementation of parceable, use of memory, sqllite, asynchronous tasks, JSON parsing, and bitmap image parsing.

This app was never intended to look pretty.
